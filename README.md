# Pong 1001
Pong 1001 is a 2023 revamp of the classic Atari game, Pong(1972). Inspired by the newest trend, Tetris 99, we have taken the old Pong and put a spin on it, increasing difficulty, fun, entertainment, and strategy in the process. Through a new ball duplication feature, players will combat each other whilst facing twice as many balls every thirty seconds. Not to mention, with the ability to spike or roll balls players have the opportunity to strategize their game plan.
